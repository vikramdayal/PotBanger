Pot Banger

Potbanger is a java application that uses the RxTx library to communicate with the Arduino board. There is an Arduino servo3 application which communicates with this application. This PotBanger application allows users to program indivual beats to bars to tell the ardunio board to initiate servo motors to bang pots and create music. Please have a look at my utube video to see how this works.

As usual, please feel free to make any enancements that others can enjoy. At a later stage, we can create another repository of music created by the potbanger.

Note: The GUI has been developed using Netbeans API. Granted, there are better IDEs like Intellij, but Netbeans is still the best IDE if you want to do GUI deevlopment. If you are making GUI changes, please use Netbeans only.
